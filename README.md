Loupedeck: Node.js Interface
============================

![tests](https://github.com/foxxyz/loupedeck/workflows/tests/badge.svg?branch=master)

Unofficial Node.js API for [Loupedeck Live](https://loupedeck.com/products/loupedeck-live/) controllers.

![Loupedeck Live Interface](https://github.com/foxxyz/loupedeck/blob/master/docs/device-front-small.png?raw=true)

Supports:

 * Reading button presses
 * Reading knob turns
 * Reading touch events
 * Setting button colors
 * Setting screen brightness
 * Vibrating device
 * Writing screen graphics

Requirements
------------

 * Node 14+
 * Loupedeck

This library has been tested with firmware versions 0.1.79 and 0.2.5. Other versions may work.

Installation
------------

```shell
npm install loupedeck
```

By default, `loupedeck` handles RGB565 (16-bit) buffers for drawing. To enable a more pleasant API that allows for drawing using [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) callbacks, also install `canvas`:

```shell
npm install canvas
```

Usage Examples
--------------

_Note: Ensure Loupedeck software is not running as it may conflict with this library_

```javascript
const { LoupedeckDevice } = require('loupedeck')

// Detects and opens first connected device
const device = new LoupedeckDevice()

// Observe connect events
device.on('connect', () => {
    console.info('Connection successful!')
})

// React to button presses
device.on('down', ({ id }) => {
    console.info(`Button pressed: ${id}`)
})

// React to knob turns
device.on('rotate', ({ id, delta }) => {
    console.info(`Knob ${id} rotated: ${delta}`)
})
```

For all examples, see the [`examples` folder](/examples/). Running examples requires `canvas` to be installed (see above).

üìù API Docs
-----------

### Class `LoupedeckDevice`

Main device class.

All incoming messages are emitted as action events and can be subscribed to via `device.on()`.

### `LoupedeckDevice.list({ ignoreSerial : Boolean?, ignoreWebsocket : Boolean?} = {}) : Promise`

Static method to scan for and return a list of all detected devices. This includes ones which are already opened.

 - `ignoreSerial`: Ignore devices which operate over serial (Firmware 0.2.X) (default: false)
 - `ignoreWebsocket`: Ignore devices which operate over websocket (Firmware 0.1.X) (default: false)
 
Device info can be directly passed on to the constructor below.

#### `new LoupedeckDevice({ path : String?, host : String?, autoConnect : Boolean? })`

Create a new Loupedeck device interface.

Most use-cases should omit the `host`/`path` parameter, unless you're using multiple devices or know specifically which IP or device path you want to connect to. Either use `path` OR `host`, never both.

 - `path`: **(Firmware 0.2.X only)** Serial device path (example: `/dev/cu.ttymodem-1332` or `COM2`) (default: autodiscover)
 - `host`: **(Firmware 0.1.X only)** Host or IP address to connect to (example: `127.100.1.1`) (default: autodiscover)
 - `autoConnect`: Automatically connect during construction. (default: `true`) _Set to `false` if you'd prefer to call [`connect()`](#deviceconnect--promise). yourself._
 - `reconnectInterval`: How many milliseconds to wait before attempting a reconnect after a failed connection (default: `3000`) _Set to `false` to turn off automatic reconnects._

#### Event: `'connect'`

Emitted when connection to the device succeeds. Includes an info object containing:

 - `address`: Connection address (E.G. serial path or websocket address)
 
#### Event: `'disconnect'`

Emitted when a device disconnects for any reason. First argument for the event is an `Error` object in case of an abnormal disconnect (otherwise `undefined`).

#### Event: `'down'`

Emitted when a button or knob is pressed down.

Arguments:
 - `id`: Button ID ([see `constants.js` for possible IDs](https://github.com/foxxyz/loupedeck/blob/master/constants.js#L3))

#### Event: `'rotate'`

Emitted when a knob is rotated.

Arguments:
 - `id`: Button ID ([see `constants.js` for possible IDs](https://github.com/foxxyz/loupedeck/blob/master/constants.js#L3))
 - `delta`: Rotation direction, `-1` for counter-clockwise, `1` for clockwise.

#### Event: `'touchstart'`

Emitted when any part of the screen is touched for the first time.

Arguments:
 - `changedTouches`: Array of new [touches](#touch-objects) created during this event
 - `touches`: Array of all currently held [touches](#touch-objects) on screen

#### Event: `'touchmove'`

Emitted when a touch moves across the screen.

Arguments:
 - `changedTouches`: Array of [touches](#touch-objects) changed during this event
 - `touches`: Array of all currently held [touches](#touch-objects) on screen

#### Event: `'touchend'`

Emitted when a touch is no longer detected.

Arguments:
 - `changedTouches`: Array of [touches](#touch-objects) removed during this event
 - `touches`: Array of all currently held [touches](#touch-objects) on screen (if any)

#### Event: `'up'`

Emitted when a button or knob is released.

Arguments:
 - `id`: Button ID (see [`device.js`](https://github.com/foxxyz/loupedeck/blob/master/device.js#L5) for valid button names)
 
#### `device.close() : Promise`

Close device connection.

Returns Promise which resolves once the device has been closed.

#### `device.connect() : Promise`

#### `device.drawBuffer({ id : String, width : Number, height : Number, x? : Number, y? : Number, autoRefresh? : Boolean }, buffer : Buffer) : Promise`

Draw graphics to a particular area using a RGB16-565 pixel buffer.

Lower-level method if [`drawKey()`](#devicedrawkeykey--number-buffercallback--bufferfunction) or [`drawScreen()`](#devicedrawscreenscreenid--string-buffercallback--bufferfunction) don't meet your needs.
